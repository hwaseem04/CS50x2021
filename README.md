Notes
----------

- All codes is this repository work well with `clang` compiler and `cs50.h` header file.
- You can compile any file in this repository with run `make [file_name]` except `hacker2/crack.c` file you need to compile it with `clang -o crack crack.c -lcrypt`.
- You can run any compiled code with `./[file_name] [command_line_arguments]` (`command_line_argument` depends on the code).
